# Stanford Algorithms Specialization Solutions  

This repository contains my solutions and notes from the [Stanford Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) on Coursera. Taught by Tim Roughgarden, this specialization dives deep into algorithm design and analysis, providing the tools to solve computational problems efficiently.  

## What I Learned  
- **Divide and Conquer:** Efficient problem-solving techniques using recursion, including merge sort and integer multiplication.  
- **Graph Algorithms:** Depth-first search, breadth-first search, shortest paths, and spanning trees.  
- **Dynamic Programming:** Solving optimization problems like the knapsack problem and sequence alignment.  
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Strategies for solving problems like scheduling and Huffman encoding.  
- **NP-Completeness:** Understanding intractable problems and approximation algorithms.  

## Content  
- **Solutions:** Implementations of algorithms and problem sets in Python and Java.  
- **Notes:** Summaries of concepts, examples, and key takeaways from each module.  
- **Resources:** Links to supplementary materials and tools for better understanding.
